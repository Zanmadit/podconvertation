Here are the 7 slides:

**Slide 1: Introduction to Learning Python**
Title: Learning Python the Right Way
Points:
- Find something you actually want to do with Python
- Having a project or goal in mind is crucial for motivation

**Slide 2: Choosing a Project**
Title: Pick a Project that Challenges You
Points:
- It can be a crazy problem you want to solve
- It can be a small bot or automating a task
- Make it something that interests you

**Slide 3: Using Pre-trained Models and Machine Learning**
Title: Using Machine Learning to Learn Python
Points:
- Use pre-trained models to do something cool
- Learn just enough to run the model and figure out the basics
- A good way to get started with Python and machine learning

**Slide 4: Learning Python in a Short Amount of Time**
Title: Can You Learn Python in a Short Amount of Time?
Points:
- You can't expect to learn Python from a one-hour video
- But, you can learn something in an hour to get hooked
- It takes skill to be an educator and condense complex ideas into a short time

**Slide 5: The Role of Practice and Experience**
Title: The Importance of Practice and Experience
Points:
- You can memorize syntax, but that doesn't make you a coder
- The 10-year experience is about the pain and practice along the way
- Coding involves copying and adjusting code from others

**Slide 6: The Impact of AI on Coding**
Title: The Future of Coding with AI
Points:
- AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot can write code for you
- These tools can save time and be a great assistant
- But, they don't replace the creative work of deciding what to do

**Slide 7: The Future of Programming Jobs**
Title: Are Programming Jobs Threatened by AI?
Points:
- AI helps with boring tasks, but doesn't replace creative work
- Programmers' jobs are not threatened by AI or Stack Overflow
- AI is a tool to augment and assist, not replace human programmers
